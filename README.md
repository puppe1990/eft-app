# EFT Tapping App

This app is designed to help users practice the Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT), also known as tapping. EFT is a form of psychological acupressure that involves tapping on specific points on the body while focusing on a specific issue or emotion.

## How to use the app
Enter the issue or emotion that you want to focus on in the "Issue or emotion to focus on" field.
Enter your current feeling level (on a scale from 0 to 10) in the "Feeling (on a scale from 0 to 10)" field.
(Optional) Check the "Use custom phrases" box if you want to use custom phrases for your tapping instead of the default phrases.
Click the "Tap" button to start the tapping process. The app will display the phrases for each round of tapping and log the feeling level after each round.

## Custom phrases
You can use the app with the default phrases, or you can create your own custom phrases by adding them to the CUSTOM_PHRASES array in the EFT class. Make sure to include the [issue] placeholder in your phrases where you want the specific issue or emotion to be inserted.

## Additional features
Some ideas for additional features that could be added to the app:

1. Displaying the tapping points on the screen and/or providing audio guidance for tapping on each point
2. Providing a timer for the tapping rounds
3. Allowing the user to add and save multiple issues to work on during different tapping sessions
4. Adding a progress tracker to show the user's progress over time
5. Providing additional resources and information about EFT and how it can be used to address different issues.
